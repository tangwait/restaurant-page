This project was very challenging because I had to create all the divs
and everything using JS and webpack. The main problems I had (but understand now) had to do with duplicate codes because of multiple entry points.

With this project, I:
    became very familiar with DOM manipulation
        >adding/removing divs in different tabs
        >using tabs/how tabs worked
    reviewed styling in CSS
    used in-line CSS in my JS
    learned import/export and using multiple files
    learned entry points/loaders/webpack
